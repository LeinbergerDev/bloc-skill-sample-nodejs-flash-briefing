This flash briefing skill template leverages [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), the [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit), and the [ASK SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx213D2XQIYH864/Announcing-the-Alexa-Skills-Kit-for-Node-js), while providing the business logic for your skill. You just need to come up with a content idea (like "Motivation Quotes"), plug in your content and edit the sample provided (we walk you through how it’s done). It's a valuable way to quickly learn the end-to-end process for building and publishing an Alexa flash briefing skill.

This tutorial will walk first-time Alexa skills developers through all the required steps involved in creating a flash briefing skill using this template. This sample assumes you have some familiarity with JavaScript/Node.js (or a similar programming language) and the Alexa Skills Kit.

Using the Alexa Skills Kit, you can build an application that can receive and respond to voice requests made on the Alexa platform.  In this tutorial, you’ll build a web service to handle requests from Alexa and map this service to a flash briefing skill in the Amazon Developer Portal, making it available on your device and to all Alexa users after certification.

 After completing this tutorial, you will know how to:

   * **Create a flash briefing skill** - This tutorial will walk first-time Alexa skills developers through all the required steps involved in creating a flash briefing skill.
   * **Use JavaScript/Node.js and the Alexa Skills Kit to create a skill** - You will use this template as a guide but the customization is up to you. For more background information on using the Alexa Skills Kit please [watch this video](https://goto.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1087595).
   * **Get your skill published** - Once you have completed your skill, this tutorial will guide you through testing your skill and sending your skill through the certification process, making it available to be enabled by any Alexa user.
